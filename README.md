## Description
The project implements Ranking System for the English Premier League.
The EPL is contested by 20 clubs which runs from August to May with each team playing 38 matches 
playing all 19 teams home and away. 
The Ranking System is based on the Wins, Loss and draws between each team. Probability of any two 
teams given as input is also calculated.

## Run Instructions
* Run the program from ReadExcel file which is the entry point for execution.
* User will be given a choice of dataset viz 2018-19 or the current season. Enter 1 or 2 as stated
    * Once data sheet is selected(say 1 is written and press enter), 
respective teams of the season will be displayed and 
a number is associated to each team in order to minimize human error. Example
    * Type 12 2(separated by space) and press enter --> gives win probability of team 12 and team 2
* If a valid number from the list is selected and the two numbers are separated by space:
* Output will be displayed which will contain the below -
    * List of home and away team with their wins and losses
    * Rankings of all these teams
    * And probability

 
## Output Verification
As professor has mentioned - Although Liverpool must end the season at the top of
                             the table (it is mathematically impossible for any other team to pass them), 
                             our ranking system draws the same conclusion.
